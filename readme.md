I had a blast at TechBash 2023! It was an amazing opportunity to network with other developers and learn about the latest trends and innovations in the tech industry. One of the highlights for me was discovering a new technology from Microsoft that blew my mind: Project Tye. Tye is a tool that aims to simplify the development, testing, and deployment of microservices and distributed applications. It allows you to run multiple services locally with minimal configuration, debug them with ease, and deploy them to Kubernetes or Azure with just one command. Tye also provides a dashboard where you can monitor the health and performance of your services. I think Tye is a game-changer for anyone who works with microservices and distributed systems. I can't wait to try it out on my own projects and see what it can do!
