### Architects and the Architecture Domain - talk 2
Are you a developer in a shop with a enterprise staff principle architect? yeah titles get crazy.
hopefully this will guide you to the "Correct" architect for your goals.

Any architect of any title can fall into one of these groups- **TALKING POINT**this is opinion


How many of us have dealt with an architect who has proposed some ancient solution based on methodolgies that have been proven innefective...
**TALKING POINT** tone sounds like im digging for dirt on architects! - segway into next slide


## Pain of architecture
In the field of technology, continuous learning and adaptation are crucial due to the rapid evolution of technologies. Any perceived decline in effectiveness might be more related to the challenges of keeping pace with these changes, rather than a decline in capabilities. It's important to consider other factors like the evolving nature of technology, the increasing complexity of systems, and changes in educational or training approaches that might affect the skill sets of professionals over time.

**TALKING POINT** Lotsa blame no love! - examples. devs get the instant feedback loop what the did works! architects usually get an ulcer waiting to find out the next steps work..


**Where They Shine: Risk Management**  
Beyond just technical stack considerations, non-coding architects have a broad skill set that allows them to understand how new service components might impact the system as a whole. They excel in scenarios where there's a need to anticipate and mitigate risks, such as adding new features that might overload a database server. For instance, they can foresee the implications of a new system performing mass updates during another system's critical processes, allowing for better risk mitigation.

#### Types of Architects
While titles may vary across companies, the roles of architects generally fall into similar categories.

The distinction between an architect who codes and one who doesn't is significant in the tech industry, each bringing unique strengths and facing different challenges. Here's a comparison of the two:
### Architect Who Doesn't Code

**Strengths**:
1. **Broad Strategic Focus**: They often have a broader view, focusing on strategy, planning, and overall system design.
2. **Risk Management**: They might be better at identifying and mitigating risks that are not purely technical.
3. **Client-Focused Solutions**: Their solutions can be more aligned with client needs and business goals.
4. **Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge**: They often possess a wider range of knowledge across various domains.

**Challenges**:
1. **Technical Communication Gap**: There may be a communication gap with the development team due to a lack of technical expertise.
2. **Keeping Up with Tech Trends**: Staying informed about the latest technologies can be more challenging without hands-on experience.
3. **Risk of Unrealistic Designs**: They might design systems or features without fully understanding the technical limitations or complexities.

### Architect Who Codes

**Strengths**:
1. **Technical Expertise**: They have hands-on experience with coding, which helps in understanding the practical aspects of implementing a design.
2. **Problem-Solving**: Their coding experience enables them to foresee and solve technical problems more effectively.
3. **Communication with Developers**: They can communicate more efficiently with the development team, as they speak the same technical language.
4. **Keeping Skills Up-to-Date**: They are more likely to be updated with the latest programming trends and technologies.
5. **Practical Solutions**: Their solutions are often more grounded in what is technically feasible.

**Challenges**:
1. **Risk of Getting Too Involved in Details**: They might get too caught up in coding details, losing sight of the broader strategic goals.
2. **Balancing Time**: Finding the right balance between architectural responsibilities and coding can be challenging.
3. **Biased Towards Familiar Technologies**: They might favor solutions based on their coding experience rather than exploring new or different technologies.



### Conclusion
Both types of architects play vital roles in the tech industry. Architects who code bring valuable technical insight and practicality to the table, while those who donâ€™t code excel in strategic planning and broad vision. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the project, the team composition, and the overall goals of the organization. Often, a balance between both types of architects leads to the most effective and innovative solutions.
