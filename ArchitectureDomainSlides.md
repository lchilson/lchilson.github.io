# Architects and the Architecture Domain
### Talk 2



---

## Architect Categories

Any architect, regardless of title, can fall into one of these groups. 

> **TALKING POINT**: This is opinion-based.

---

## Architectural Challenges

How many of us have dealt with an architect proposing an outdated solution based on methodologies that have proven ineffective?
or
Something bleeding edge that gets all the devs stoked about working with it only to find the learning curve so high its just not feasible given time and cost?
--really hate when that happens

Maybe someone in the middle? thats the sweet spot..

> **TALKING POINT**: This may sound like digging for dirt on architects! Let's segue into the next slide.

## The Pain of Architecture

In technology, continuous learning and adaptation are crucial. Any perceived decline in effectiveness might relate more to the challenges of keeping pace with technology, not a decline in capabilities. Even the latest and greatest shiney toy is bound to have a security flaw.

## Docker
I personaly in my shop have adviocated for docker since day 1! but as a developer i only saw the new and shiney. i only wanted to use it to benifit the company! Its what i still belive but have learned over time.

## Where They Shine: Risk Management

Architects have a broad skill set, understanding the impact of new service components on the system. They excel in anticipating and mitigating risks.

> **Example**: Foreseeing implications of a new system performing mass updates during another system's critical processes.

## Types of Architects

While titles may vary, the roles of architects generally fall into similar categories. Let's compare architects who code and those who don't.

### Architect Who Doesn't Code

**Strengths**:
1. Broad Strategic Focus
2. Risk Management
3. Client-Focused Solutions
4. Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge

**Challenges**:
1. Technical Communication Gap
2. Keeping Up with Tech Trends
3. Risk of Unrealistic Designs

---

### Architect Who Codes

**Strengths**:
1. Technical Expertise
2. Problem-Solving
3. Communication with Developers
4. Keeping Skills Up-to-Date
5. Practical Solutions

**Challenges**:
1. Risk of Getting Too Involved in Details
2. Balancing Time
3. Biased Towards Familiar Technologies

## Conclusion

Both types of architects are vital. Architects who code bring technical insight, while those who donâ€™t excel in strategic planning. The choice depends on the project's needs, team composition, and organizational goals. Often, a balance between both types leads to the most effective solutions.
